# Leveraging Azure Data Factory for COVID-19 Analytics
This repository contains my COVID-19 Data Analysis Project, created as part of refreshing my skills, particularly in Azure, after my experience as an Associate Data Engineer. Leveraging Azure services, including HDInsight, HTTP transformations, Data Factory and Data Lake, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data processing and analysis.

**Project Highlights**<br>
**Azure Skills Refresh:** 
The primary goal of this project is to refresh and enhance my Azure skills by applying them to real-world data analysis challenges.

**Data Processing with HDInsight:**
Explore the power of HDInsight within Azure for efficient and scalable data processing. Leverage Apache Spark and Hadoop clusters to perform complex transformations on the COVID-19 dataset.

**Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate and streamline the development process. Ensure seamless deployment of code changes and transformations to Azure HDInsight clusters.

**Visualization with Power BI:** 
Utilize Power BI for creating interactive and insightful visualizations to communicate key findings effectively.
